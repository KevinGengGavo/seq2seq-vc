## Exp notes by Kevin:
`egs/arctic/vc2/exp/B119004_V001_SS_B119004_50_shdw_aas_vc.melmelmel.v1`
+ Original training conf for GAVO_Shadowing Dataset
`egs/arctic/vc2/conf/shdw_aas_vc.melmelmel_perf_2.v2.yaml`
+ Post_encoder_reduction_factor: 2 -> Base on paper will get no better result :(


# Parallel one-to-one non-autoregreseive (non-AR) seq2seq VC recipe using the CMU ARCTIC dataset

2023.09.

This recipe describes two types of non-AR seq2seq VC model described in our paper, "AAS-VC: On the Generalization Ability of Automatic Alignment Search based Non-autoregressive Sequence-to-sequence Voice Conversion".

- [AAS-VC](#aas-vc)
- [FS2-VC](#fs2-vc)

### Naming convention of config files

Each configuration file name contains three feature types, like `conf/aas_vc.melmelmel.v1.yaml`. They represent the feature types to the source encoder, target encoder and duration predictor, respectively. When using a different config file, please set the corresponding command line arguments `--src_feat XXX --trg_feat YYY --dp_feat ZZZ` correctly.

## AAS-VC

The automatic alignment search based non-AR seq2seq VC model.

### MUST READ notes before training

#### Encoder reduction factor

The default config is `conf/aas_vc.melmelmel.v1.yaml`. A hyperparameter that **MUST** be carefully set is the following:

```
model_params:
    ...
    post_encoder_reduction_factor: 4
    ...
```

Ignore the "post", this hyperparameter controls the "compresses rate" of the encoder output feature sequence before we send it into the attention learning module. It is ESSENTIAL to properly set this number: the automatic alignment search method requires that **in EVERY parallel pair, the length of the source utterance needs to be reduced such that it is shorter than that of the target utterance**. It is recommended to calculate the duration ratio of EVERY training pair prior to training, and properly set this number. (Note that if this number is set to be too large, attention learning will fail.)

#### What if OOM happens during training?

If OOM happens (which is quite possible when using PPG or simply caused by a lengthy dataset), change `gradient_accumulate_steps: 1` to some number larger than 1. Note that the effective batch size will be `batch_size * gradient_accumulate_steps`.

### Training

First, extract the features, calculate the statistics and normalize all the features. This is basically the same as FS2-VC.

```
./run.sh --stage 0 --stop_stage 2 \
  --norm_name self --conf <conf_file> \
  --src_feat XXX --trg_feat YYY --dp_feat ZZZ
```

It is always recommended to explicitly set `--src_feat`, `--trg_feat` and `--dp_feat`.

Then, train the model.

```
./run.sh --stage 3 --stop_stage 3 \
  --norm_name self --conf <conf_file> \
  --src_feat XXX --trg_feat YYY --dp_feat ZZZ \
  --tag <tag_name>
```

Training results will be saved in `exp/<srcspk>_<trgspk>_<num_train_utterances>_<tag>`.

### Decoding and evaluation

Then, decoding (conversion) and evaluation can be done by executing the following (this part is also the same as FS2-VC):

```
./run.sh --stage 4 --stop_stage 5 \
  --norm_name self --conf <conf_file> \
  --src_feat XXX --trg_feat YYY --dp_feat ZZZ \
  --tag <tag_name>
```

### Config file for ablation studies

The default config file uses the following settings:

- melmelmel (see [Naming convention of config files](#naming-convention-of-config-files))
- stochastic duration predictor
- post encoder reduction factor = 4
- 932 training utterances

Change the following hyperparameters to reproduce the ablation studies.

- PPG as source and duration predictor input  
  Simply use `conf/aas_vc.ppgmelppg.v1.yaml`, and set `--src_feat ppg_sxliu --trg_feat mel --dp_feat ppg_sxliu`.

- Deterministic duration predictor
  ```
  model_params:
      duration_predictor_type: deterministic
  criterions:
    "DurationPredictorLoss": {}
  ```

- pre encoder reduction factor

  ```
  model_params:
      encoder_reduction_factor: 4
      post_encoder_reduction_factor: 1
  ```

- smaller training set
  Specify `num_train XXX` and start from the _Training_ section again. We used the followng batch size settings:
  - 932, 500, 250 utterances: batch size = 16
  - 80, 40 utterances: batch size = 8
  - 20 utterances: batch size = 4


## FS2-VC

The modified FastSpeech based VC model

This recipe attempts to implement the paper: "Non-autoregressive sequence-to-sequence voice conversion". https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06793.

### Difference from the original paper

- I did not include the pitch and energy predictors, so this is essentially just FastSpeech 1.
- The input of the duration predictor is not the encoder outputs (left of figure). Rather, I use a separate, small CNN to process the feature for the duration prediction (right of figure). This unlocks the possibility to use different features.

### Prepare the target durations for training

First please train an AR seq2seq VC model in `arctic/vc1`. I recommend using a TTS pre-trained AR seq2seq VC model, as it will greatly improve the intelligibility (in terms of DDUR, CER and WER). Note that the input and output features, as long as the decoder reduction factor need to be the same. For example, if in the AR model, the input is PPG, output is mel, and the decoder reduction factor is 4, then the non-AR model has to have the same setting.

After the training of the AR model is done, generate the durations using teacher forcing. Example:

```
./run.sh --stage 6 --stop_stage 6 --norm_name ljspeech --conf conf/vtn.tts_pt.v1.yaml --tag tts_pt_r4 --pretrained_model_checkpoint /data/group1/z44476r/Experiments/seq2seq-vc/egs/ljspeech/tts1/exp/tts_aept_phn_tacotron_r4_checkpoint-100000steps/checkpoint-50000steps.pkl
```

The generated durations will be in `exp/clb_slt_932_<tag>/results/checkpoint-50000steps/clb_train/out.1/durations/*.txt`. Example duration file:

```
1 0 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 0 2 0 1 1 1 0 1 2
```


### Training the non-AR model

Currently, following the original paper, no pre-training is used. First, extract the features, calculate the statistics and normalize all the features.

```
./run.sh --stage 0 --stop_stage 2 \
  --norm_name self --conf <conf_file> \
  --src_feat XXX --trg_feat YYY --dp_feat ZZZ
```

It is always recommended to explicitly set `--src_feat`, `--trg_feat` and `--dp_feat`.

Then, train the model.

```
./run.sh --stage 3 --stop_stage 3 \
  --norm_name self --conf <conf_file> \
  --src_feat XXX --trg_feat YYY --dp_feat ZZZ \
  --tag <tag_name> \
  --train_duration_dir <train_duration_dir> \
  --dev_duration_dir <dev_duration_dir>
```

Examples for setting `<train_duration_dir>` and `<dev_duration_dir>`:
```
train_duration_dir=/data/group1/z44476r/Experiments/seq2seq-vc/egs/arctic/vc1/exp/clb_slt_932_tts_pt_r4/results/checkpoint-50000steps/clb_train
dev_duration_dir=/data/group1/z44476r/Experiments/seq2seq-vc/egs/arctic/vc1/exp/clb_slt_932_tts_pt_r4/results/checkpoint-50000steps/clb_dev
```
Training results will be saved in `exp/<srcspk>_<trgspk>_<num_train_utterances>_<tag>`.

### Decoding and evaluation

Then, decoding (conversion) and evaluation can be done by executing the following:

```
./run.sh --stage 4 --stop_stage 5 \
  --norm_name self --conf <conf_file> \
  --src_feat XXX --trg_feat YYY --dp_feat ZZZ \
  --tag <tag_name> \
  --train_duration_dir <train_duration_dir> \
  --dev_duration_dir <dev_duration_dir>
```
